Type "standalone" is used during development of a source, where the other sources
are not part of the build. When the source is integrated with the other sources
then the type is "integration".

The idea of 'standalone' and 'integration' was first used with PWOM.

Webpack generates different chunks when building for production. So
jekyll.environment reflects the webpack mode used. This is valid only in
'integration' since 'standalone' is always development.
